Your first backend app
======

This is the shell code for the backend to our simple blogging platform. 

To get set up:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into this (blog) folder
3. Install the correct modules by just running `npm install`. When running
    that command, npm knows to look for `package.json` and install all modules
    that are required. 
4. Download, install, and run [postgres.app](postgresapp.com). Once that's running,
    run `createdb blog` on the terminal. 
5. From this directory, running `nodemon app.js` should run the app.
